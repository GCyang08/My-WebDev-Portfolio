        <p>
          I am a self-taught front end developer. I primarily focus on writing
          clean, elegant, and efficient code. I am passionate about creating
          responsive web apps and making them come to life. Iâ€™ve built a few
          projects by myself and I am looking for a role where I can grow and
          learn.
